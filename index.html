                        <p>GeoSync GO (GSGO) is a cloud-based mapping application that makes working with
geographic information simple. The service is designed to turn your data into attractive, approachable maps
that anyone can use. GSGO has powerful customization options to allow organizations to build asset
intelligence in a way that meets their needs.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h2>
<p>The activities in GSGO fall into three broad catagories:</p>
<div class="row" style="text-align:center;">
    <div class="col s12 m4">
        <i class="mdi-action-visibility small"></i><br><strong>Visualization</strong><br>Users consuming geographic information. This action encompasses interacting with the map, searching layers, browsing the 
        tabular feature data and viewing the feature data rendered on the map.<br><br>
    </div>
    <div class="col s12 m4">
        <i class="mdi-action-input small"></i><br><strong>Collection</strong><br>Users gathering information on new or existing features. This revolves around customized forms to gather pertinent data and powerful workflows that deliver reports back into your system.<br><br>
    </div>
    <div class="col s12 m4">
        <i class="mdi-action-group-work small"></i><br><strong>Management</strong><br>Administrative processes for understanding current and upcoming work. This consists of views that monitor the work being done and notifications that alert users to scheduled maintainence.<br><br>
    </div>
</div>

<p>GSGO has a flexible architecture that makes it a great tool for a wide range of scenarios. The only expectation is that the task has
an emphasis on geographic information. We have aided in implementing GSGO into a number of projects. Below is short list of common setups.</p>
<p>Utility Asset Management<br>Emergency Management<br>Fire Planning<br>MS4 Data Management<br>E911 Addressing<br>Fire Hydrant Flow Testing<br>PVA Property Mapping</p>
<h2 id="what-is-geosync-go-plus">What is GeoSync GO Plus</h2>
<p>GSGO is based around geographic data communication. The foundation is built around the simple task of importing data and then displaying it anywhere.
Our web interface is named GeoSync GO Plus (GSGO+). It is an extension of our service that puts more functionality in the cloud. The
most impactful capability enabled by GSGO+ is creating and editing maps directly on our servers.</p>
<p>A map project consists of five parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - list of people with access to the map project.</li>
<li><strong>Sources</strong> - geographic features imported into a geospatial database hosted on our servers or served from an external feature service.</li>
<li><strong>Styles</strong> - settings that allow you to control the appearance of the features.</li>
<li><strong>Layers</strong> - combination of a style and a source to make a unique element for display.</li>
<li><strong>Tilesets</strong> - background map provided by a grid of images</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these sections generate interchangable items for use on any map project. The projects section is where you create the map project
that will be a collection of the these items. Once a map project is created, it will be available to the users specified in the project. 
Those users will be able to access it from the web and any of our GSGO+ apps.</p>
<p>This is just a brief overview of GSGO+. To find out more, please read our <a href="/docs">Documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-choose-geosync-go">Why choose GeoSync GO</h2>
<p>For those not using asset management software, GSGO provides a simple way to ditch handwritten forms and manual data entry. The old way of managing field data
is slow, error-prone and too static. GSGO updates information instantly, nothing has to be typed multiple times and forms can be changed anytime. GSGO makes
it easy for anyone to use and contribute to projects.</p>
<p>For those using other GIS solutions, GSGO can complement existing workflows. You can utilize information from feature services and current data sources to 
build maps. These maps can just be a simple way to view geographic systems or they can utilize forms to continuously deliver reports from field workers.</p>
<p>For those using a product that mirrors the functionality of GSGO, we ask that you contact us so that we can give you an estimate on how much savings
switching to our service can provide.</p>
