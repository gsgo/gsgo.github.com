                    </div>
                    <div id="contents" class="col s12 m9">
                        <h2 id="administration-console">Administration Console</h2>
<p>This area is where all the configuration for our projects takes place. Only users with admin privileges can access this area.
It is broken down into sections for creating modular pieces that can be combined to form a project. </p>
<h2 id="account">Account</h2>
<p>The Account view shows current information about your account. There are four progress bars that help you track your resource usage. The limits
on each usage meter is dictated by your account tier.</p>
<p>The top bar shows the number of users on your account. If you do not have any user slots left, you will not be able to create more users.</p>
<p>The second bar shows your storage usage. This is how much space your files are occupying on our cloud service. All your geographic data along with
any uploaded media is included in this total.</p>
<p>The next bar indicates your data transfer for the month. This value reflects all the requeusts that transfer data out of your account. Viewing any data
from the map or in the Administration Console uses a small amount of data. This bandwidth usage accumulates over the period of a month. If your 
account limit is exceeded, the availability or performance of your account may be affected. At the end of the month the usage is reset and normal
operation of your account should be restored.</p>
<p>The last bar is the reports that have been submitted for the current month. Every user that saves a report will add to this total. Just like the
data transfers, this total is accumlated for one month at a time and resets at the end of the month. If the limit is exceeded no more reports will be
able to be sent to your account until the next month.</p>
<p>Every section of the console shows a grid of all the items in that category. The grid can be sorted and filtered. Every grid will have options at the
top to manage the category. The New option will be there in most circumstances, which will let you create a new item in the current category. If an item
in the category is selected, Edit and Delete options will also be available that act on the selected row. Some sections include an
Import option on the grid view. This will bring up a list of preconfigured items created by MapSync. Clicking on one of the items will
import it into your project where it can be customized.</p>
<p>In every section a name field is used with an item. In most situations the name field is there for your reference, so always set it to something that
helps to easily identify that item.</p>
<h2 id="users">Users</h2>
<p>This section lets you manage the users on your account.</p>
<p>The <strong>Login</strong> field is the username that will be entered for the user to sign in to his/her account. The login must meet certain requirements and
be available. </p>
<p><strong>Email</strong> is the user&#39;s email address.</p>
<p><strong>Password</strong> is the password that will be used to sign in. The password must meet certain requirements to be valid.</p>
<p>The <strong>Owner</strong> value indicates the primary user of the account. This user can never be deleted and has more privileges than any other user.</p>
<p>The <strong>Disabled</strong> setting makes a user inactive and prevents the user from signing in.</p>
<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
<p>Sources are the data that will used for your project. This data can come from several different locations.</p>
<p>The <strong>Type</strong> sets the format of the expected data.</p>
<p>The empty setting just makes a blank data source. Currently this is not very useful, but in the future you will be able to add features to a blank
data source, so that data can be built from scratch.</p>
<p>If the type is Shapefile, File Geodatabase, Keyhole Markup, GPS Exchange Format, Comma Separated Values, GeoJSON or MapSync GSE. The form expects a file
to be uploaded with geographic data formatted to match the type specified. </p>
<p>If Shapefile or File Geodatabase is selected, the uploaded file is expected to be in a zip file. </p>
<p>If Comma Separated Values is selected, you will need to enter the names of the fields that contain the latitude and longitude, and also the
separator character that is used in the file (default is comma).</p>
<p>If MapSync Cloud SQL is selected, the source expects a connection to a database. The form will automatically recognize any databases associated with your
account. You will need to choose which database to use and then which table to connect to.</p>
<p>If ArcGIS Feature Service or Web Feature Service is selected, the source expects a URL. This will be the base path for the feature service. In the 
case of the Web Feature Service the name of the source must match the Feature Type expected by the feature service.</p>
<h2 id="styles">Styles</h2>
<p>This sets the appearance of the data. There is preview link on the MARKER header that lets your see the marker style and a preview link on the
POLYLINE / POLYGON header that lets yon see the shape style.</p>
<h4 id="marker-options">Marker Options</h4>
<p>The <strong>Marker Type</strong> is the base style for the marker. Simple markers are flat shapes with icons on them. These markers are anchored at the center of the
feature. Simple markers have an adjustable size. The non-simple markers use shadows to show up like a map pin. With these marker, the bottom of the image is anchored to the feature location. The size 
of these markers is not adjustable.</p>
<p><strong>Marker Color</strong> is the color of the marker. If <strong>Marker Type</strong> is simple, the input accepts simple color names or hexadecimal values for complex colors.
Use the choose link to select a color from a color palette.
If <strong>Marker Type</strong> is non-simple, the color is selected from a dropdown box.</p>
<p><strong>Marker Opacity</strong> sets the transparency of the marker.</p>
<p><strong>Marker Icon</strong> is the symbol that appears on the marker. Use the choose link to select from a list of icons.</p>
<p><strong>Icon Color</strong> is the color of the marker icon. Input works the same as the simple marker color input.</p>
<p><strong>Marker Size</strong> and <strong>Icon Size</strong> are only available for simple markers. It increases or decreases the pixel size of the marker and icon.</p>
<p><strong>Clickable</strong> means that the user can click the marker and select the feature on the map. Disabling this can
be ideal for layers that are only provided for reference and have no need to be selected by the user.</p>
<p><strong>Label Display</strong> sets whether a label is attached to the marker. By default there is no label. You can set a label to appear when a user hovers over a marker
or a label can be set to always be visible.</p>
<h4 id="polyline-polygon-options">Polyline / Polygon Options</h4>
<p><strong>Stroke Color</strong> is the exterior color of the shape. In polylines, this will be the only visible color. In polygons, this color is the outline of the shape.</p>
<p><strong>Fill Color</strong> is the interior color of the shape.</p>
<p><strong>Stroke Opacity</strong> is the transparency of the shape exterior.</p>
<p><strong>Fill Opacity</strong> is the transparency of the shape interior.</p>
<p><strong>Stroke Pattern</strong> allows you to set the appearance of the line stroke. By default it is a solid line, but can be set to have a dotted or dashed appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Fill Rule</strong> is how the interior of a complex shape is determined. In most circumstances, this can be ignored, but if there is a complex shape that is
not being rendered correctly, it might help to change the fill rule for that shape.</p>
<p><strong>Stroke Weight</strong> is the thickness of the line stroke. A higher number will make the line wider.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Factor</strong> is how much to simplify the shape exterior to display a smoother line. Increasing this can be helpful for map performance if you have 
a shape with a lot of points.</p>
<p><strong>Stroke Visible</strong> sets the visibility of the shape exterior. Turning this off will make polylines invisible.</p>
<p><strong>Fill Visible</strong> sets the visibility of the shape interior. For polygons,
this allows you show a shape with an interior shading.</p>
<p><strong>Clickable</strong> means that the user can click the shape to select the feature on the map.</p>
<p>By default, a marker is placed at the center of a shape. If you want the shape to be displayed without a marker, enable <strong>Hide Marker</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Label Display</strong> sets whether a label is attached to the shape. By default there is no label. You can set a label to appear when a user hovers over a shape
or a label can be set to always be visible.</p>
<h2 id="layers">Layers</h2>
<p><strong>Type</strong> determines how users interact with the layer. A Base Layer can always be seen regardless of the active layer that is set. Multiple Base Layers can
all be rendered on the map at the same time. Feature Sets are only selected one at a time from the layer toolbar. When a different Feature Set is
selected the previous Feature Set is unloaded.</p>
<p>The main adavantage to Base Layers is that an entire map with multiple, selectable layers can be presented. Users wouldn&#39;t need to switch layers to 
interact with all the features. The downside is that if there a lot of Base Layers in your project, this could not only make your map complicated 
to understand, but it could effect the performance of the map, especially on mobile devices. Also, the data transfer usage of your project would be
higher because more data is being sent per map redraw.</p>
<p>Feature Sets provide a simpler experience where users can see and interact with the data of one layer. The other upside is that Feature Sets enable 
the Grid View option that allows the data to be viewed in a spreadsheet-like format. However, users would have to understand how to switch between
layers with the layer toolbar to work effectively with Feature Sets.</p>
<p>There is not just one way to create layers. You will probably want to mix and match layer types to provide the best experience and that can vary
depending on an organization&#39;s needs.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Zoom</strong> is the highest zoom level that the layer will be displayed. <strong>Maximum Zoom</strong> is the lowest level that the layer will be displayed. These
two values create a range where your layer will be visible. If you start zooming down from level 1, the <strong>Minimum Zoom</strong> is the first level where your
layer will be seen and as your keep zooming, the <strong>Maximum Zoom</strong> is the last level where your layer will be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Draw Limit</strong> is the number of features that will displayed in one map view. This number helps to tune the performance of your map. If there is a dense
area of features in your map, you might want to use this setting to make sure the layers work consistently across all devices.</p>
<p><strong>Draw Priority</strong> is a value that determines the order of layers when multiple layers are displayed at once. The lower the Draw Priority of a layer, the
higher it is placed on the stack of other layers. You can think of it like a competition, first place gets placed on top. Likewise, a Draw Priority
of one is placed on top of the other layers.</p>
<p><strong>Disable Dynamic Loading</strong> lets you change how your layer is viewed on the map. By default, a layer is requested and redrawn based on the bounding box
of the current map view. This allows large layers to be performant by requesting one piece at a time. If this setting is enabled, then the layer 
is loaded all at once on the map and not redrawn when the map view changes. This can be a useful setting for smaller layers or layers that you wish
to cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Enable Clustering</strong> is only available when <strong>Disable Dynamic Loading</strong> is checked. This setting groups the layer features together and allows the user to
click on the groups to drill down to the features. As you get lower the groups separate into smaller groups and eventually the selectable features will
be displayed. If features are still close together at the maximum zoom level of the map a cluster will still be displayed, but the user can click on the cluster to
view a selectable list of features in the cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Initially Toggled Off</strong> is only available if the <strong>Type</strong> is set to Base Layer. This setting turns the Base Layer off by default and the user will have
to use the Base Layers view from the map to make the layer visible.</p>
<h4 id="source">Source</h4>
<p>The <strong>Source</strong> is the data that the layer will use. The list includes all the sources created in the sources section.</p>
<p>The <strong>Label Field</strong> is the data that will be used to display a label if the style is set to show a label. This should be a field that helps the user
recognize a feature. This is the first field that is an autocomplete field. Depending on the selected source, this input will populate with
a list of fields. When you click into the input, you can select a field from the list or you can ignore the options and type the field name.</p>
<p><strong>Filters</strong> allow you to pull specific data out of the source. This is very useful for displaying a subset of data in your layer. With filters, you can
split data from a single source into multiple layers. To create a filter rule, set the field, the operator and the value and click the add button (+).
This can be repeated as many times as needed to create a complex filter. In our getting started example we could create a filter on the Subway
Stations layer to only show the stations on the red subway line. We would set the field to LINE, use the equal (=) operator, set the value to
RED and click the add button (+).</p>
<h4 id="style">Style</h4>
<p>This is where we set the appearance of our layer. The list includes all the styles created in the styles section.</p>
<p>The <strong>Default Style</strong> is required and sets the style of the entire layer.</p>
<p><strong>Conditional Styles</strong> are set just like filters, but instead of filtering they apply styles based on the statement. All Conditional Styles are applied to
a layer first, if no Conditional Styles apply to a feature then the Default Style is used. Like our filter example, we can set the field to LINE, 
use the equal (=) operator, set the value to RED and click the add button (+). Now we have a selection next to the rule that allows us to apply a style
to all the features that match that rule. In this case we could have a style that makes all the markers red, then we could set all the stations on
the red subway line to have red markers.</p>
<h2 id="tilesets">Tilesets</h2>
<p><strong>Tile Size</strong> is the pixel width of the tiles in the tileset. This is typically 256, but if a service uses a different tile size it can be set here.</p>
<p><strong>URL Template</strong> is the URL used to load the tiles formatted with a few variable values so that the map knows how to request the tiles. A sample template looks
like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">http://otile{s}.mqcdn.com/tiles/1.0.0/osm/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
</code></pre>
<p>{s} = The possible subdomains for the tile service. If only served from one subdomain, this variable can be left out.<br>{z} = The current zoom level of the map.<br>{x} = The x position of the tile.<br>{y} = The y position of the tile.  </p>
<p>Depending on the service these variables should be at different positions in the URL.</p>
<p><strong>Subdomains</strong> is the list of subdomains the tiles are served from. Tile services use multiple subdomains to increase the reliability of serving map tiles.
An example list is below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Each letter is a different subdomain.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution</strong> is the text that appears at the bottom of the map when displaying tiles from the tileset. This is sometimes necessary to meet the licensing
requirements of using a tile service.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Zoom</strong> and <strong>Maximum Zoom</strong> is the same as on a layer. This is the range of zoom levels where the tileset will be visible.</p>
<p><strong>Opacity</strong> sets the transparency of the tiles displayed on the map.</p>
<p><strong>Z Index</strong> is the order that the tilesets are stacked in if there are multiple tilesets shown at the same time. A higher Z Index means the tileset is
higher on the stack and will be shown on top of tilesets with a lower Z Index.</p>
<p><strong>Initially Toggled Off</strong> works the same as with the Base Layer. This will make the tileset off by default. The user has the ability to go to the Tilesets
view in the map to turn on the tileset.</p>
<h2 id="searches">Searches</h2>
<p>A search allows the user to lookup data from a specific source. </p>
<p><strong>Source</strong> is the data that will be used to search against.</p>
<p><strong>Search Field</strong> is the field that will be the target of the search. Anything searched by the user will use this field to look for approximate matches.</p>
<p><strong>Display Fields</strong> is a list of fields to display in addition to the search field. These allow you to provide more information with your search results.</p>
<p><strong>Filters</strong> work identically to layer filters. They can force the search to only use a subset of the source data.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>This is how we assemble all the work we&#39;ve done.</p>
<p><strong>Alias</strong> is a simple identifier for the project. In the case of a project that is using forms created in GeoSync GO Desktop, this field will need to be set
to the Project ID of any existing project.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Latitude</strong>, <strong>Initial Longitude</strong> and <strong>Initial Zoom</strong> are all values that determine where the map is positioned on the initial loading of the project. Use the choose
link to set these values by using the map preview.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Zoom</strong> and <strong>Maximum Zoom</strong> set the zoom levels for the entire project. The user will not be able to zoom out beyond the <strong>Minimum Zoom</strong> or zoom in
beyond the <strong>Maximum Zoom</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Public Access</strong> makes the project available at a direct web URL and also lists the map in the Discover Maps interface. This is useful for sharing a map
with a large group without having to create individual user accounts.</p>
<p>If <strong>Public Access</strong> is enabled, the <strong>Path</strong> field is available. By default this is populated by a random ID. This path will be the unique part of the URL for
your map. This can be changed to something more readable, but it must be unique across all public maps. This field will check to see if the path is
available before saving.</p>
<p>A <strong>Passphrase</strong> can also be set for public maps. This a simple test to insure the user should be allowed to view the public map. This passphrase should just
be considered a simple form of security. The passphrase could be guessed or shared to provide access to unknown parties. If the Passphrase is left blank
then the map will be open to anyone with the URL.</p>
<p>The <strong>Description</strong> adds information to your public map listing on the discover maps page. The public map name and description will be available on the
search results.</p>
<p>The <strong>Disabled</strong> option makes a project inactive and prevents anyone from accessing it.</p>
<h4 id="users">Users</h4>
<p>The USERS section allows you to set the users who have access to the project. By default, no one has access. Select the desired user and click the add
button (+) to link the user to the project. After adding a user to the project, you can then set permissions for that user. The top checkboxes of the
permissions is related to the reading, writing and deleting of feature links.</p>
<p><i class="mdi-action-visibility small left"></i> This option gives the user permission to view the links that are related to the selected feature. If 
disabled, the users LINKS tab on the Properties Pane will always be empty.</p>
<p><i class="mdi-image-edit small left"></i> This setting lets the user attach new links to a selected feature. If disabled, the attach link button will
not be visible for the user.</p>
<p><i class="mdi-action-delete small left"></i> This lets a user delete links from a selected feature. This action is not implemented yet.</p>
<p>The Forms section of the permissions only has one option:</p>
<p><i class="mdi-image-edit small left"></i> This option allows the user to open forms and create reports for the selected feature. If disabled, the
buttons for creating and editing reports will be hidden. Also, the History section of the Action Menu will not be available.</p>
<p>If <strong>Public Access</strong> is enabled, then there will also be section listed here to set the permissions for all public users.</p>
<h4 id="layers">Layers</h4>
<p>Set all the layers available in the project. To add a layer select it in the dropdown and click the add button (+).</p>
<p>The <strong>Default Layer</strong> option allows you to define a Feature Set that will automatically be set as the active layer when the map is loaded. Items will only be
available in this list if you have added a Feature Set to the project layers.</p>
<h4 id="tilesets">Tilesets</h4>
<p>Set all the tilests available in the project. To add a tileset select it in the dropdown and click the add button (+).</p>
<h4 id="searches">Searches</h4>
<p>Set all the searches available in the project. To add a search select it in the dropdown and click the add button (+).</p>
